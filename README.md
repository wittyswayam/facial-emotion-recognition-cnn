# facial-emotion-recognition-cnn
A deep learning project for detecting and classifying human facial emotions using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in Python. The model is trained to recognize multiple emotions (such as happy, sad, angry, surprise, etc.) from facial images, providing real-time predictions through image input or webcam feed.
